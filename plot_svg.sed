# Sometimes, Octave generates a black background instead of a white background,
# causing weird borders to appear when the SVG is rendered. This seems to happen
# somewhat randomly and is hard to reproduce. We work around the problem by
# fixing the SVG after the fact. Basically, if the first polygon in the file is
# black, we change it to white.
