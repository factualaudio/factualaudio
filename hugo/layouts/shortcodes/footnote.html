{{/*
	This creates an inline footnote. See static/inline_footnote.js for details.
	The output is defined in such a way that footnotes are still readable even if Javascript is
	disabled (which is especially important for people using RSS readers and "readifiers").

	NOTE: when editing this file, make sure not to add a final newline character
	      (see https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2134)

	NOTE: be advised, link references don't work properly in the content of a shortcode. Links
	      need to be fully inlined. (see https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2131)

	NOTE: avoid nesting footnotes, bigfoot.js doesn't like that.
	      (see https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot/issues/53)

	NOTE: be very careful when changing the markup. Pocket Article view doesn't seem to like
	      nested spans, for example, and might omit contents at random.
	      (Also don't use class name "note", Pocket Article View on Android does something
	      weird in that case. Don't ask. Oh, and don't use a class name that starts with
	      "footnote" either, that confuses Bigfoot. Sigh...)
