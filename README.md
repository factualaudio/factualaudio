This is the source code repository for Factual Audio, a website dedicated to delivering objective, trustworthy, reliable, evidence-backed information about audio, in particular audio playback in the home and on the move.

The Factual Audio website is built from this repository, and the resulting contents can be found in the [adjacent repository](https://github.com/factualaudio/factualaudio.github.io) where the actual website is served from. The site itself is generated using the [Hugo static site generator][]. Most of the figures are generated from Python programs leveraging the [matplotlib][] library.
