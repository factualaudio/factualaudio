	This creates an inline footnote. See static/inline_footnote.js for details.
	The output is defined in such a way that footnotes are still readable even if Javascript is
	disabled (which is especially important for people using "readifiers").

	NOTE: when editing this file, make sure not to add a final newline character
	      (see https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2134)

	NOTE: be advised, link references don't work properly in the content of a shortcode. Links
	      need to be fully inlined. (see https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2131)
